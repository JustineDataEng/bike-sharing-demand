# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction (Kaggle Competition)

This repository contains my solution notebook for the Kaggle **Bike Sharing Demand** competition.

The objective of the competition is to predict the hourly demand for bike rentals based on historical usage patterns and weather-related features.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Loaded and explored the bike-sharing dataset
- Performed basic data preprocessing and feature handling
- Trained machine learning models to predict bike rental demand
- Generated predictions suitable for Kaggle submission

This notebook represents my learning and experimentation process as a data science and engineering student.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## Machine Learning Workflow

The notebook follows a typical data science pipeline:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Feature selection and preprocessing
3. Model training
4. Prediction generation
